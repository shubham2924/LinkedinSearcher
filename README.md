# LinkedinSearcher - 
#### A simple chrome extension that let's you search for any person/company/organization on linkedin on a single click.
 This is the first attempt for developing chrome extension browser.
 Might be useful for analysts/researcher where efforts (for copying specific content -> opening linkedin site -> clicking on search tool -> pasting the name) of this process are eliminated.

 P.S : 

 - Manifesh version 2(V2) is being used for the development of this chrome extension as V3 is recommended but onclick event listener(chrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener(yourFunctionName);) was facing a problem on opening a new tab(chrome.tabs.create({url:"www.google.com"})). But as it is open source project feel free to raise a PR if you find any solution while using V3.

 - User needs to be logged in on their linkedin account in the browser.
